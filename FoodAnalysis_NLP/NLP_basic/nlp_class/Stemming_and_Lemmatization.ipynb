This indiscriminate cutting can be successful in some occasions, but not always, and that is why we affirm that this approach presents some limitations. \n",
    "- Lemmatization, on the other hand, takes into consideration the morphological analysis of the words. To do so, it is necessary to have detailed dictionaries which the algorithm can look through to link the form back to its lemma\n",
    "- Another important difference to highlight is that a lemma is the base form of all its inflectional forms, whereas a stem isnâ€™t. This is why regular dictionaries are lists of lemmas, not stems.\n"
